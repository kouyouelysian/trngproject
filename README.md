# TRNG PROJECT

this is the repository of my true random number generator project

that i made for my bachelor's thesis.


it contains python scripts used for collecting and analysing data,

c firmware for arduino and some additional images and photos.

## python scripts

each script has a brief description in the beginning. basically, trnglib.py is the interface library for the arduino.

for a simple example, check demo_simpletest.py

## arduino firmware

flash this to an arduino nano, assemble the circuit for noise generation, and you're ready to run the calibration utility script!

## additional data

some photos, visualiser work results, graphs, and the hardware circuit.

# custom permissions

you can make such a TRNG for your own entertainment, but credit me if you end up showcasing it somewhere!


don't host the code elsewhere: this is the only place for it, and everyone can get it here for free.


And, of course, do not recopyright this to your own name!!

except this thing is so slow, why would you.
